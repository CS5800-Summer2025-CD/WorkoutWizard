# This trigger tells GitHub to run the script whenever you push code
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Download your code from GitHub onto the virtual machine
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up the Docker building tool
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    # Step 3: Run the build command (just like you did in Week 1)
    # If this fails, the whole "Action" fails, alerting you to a bug
